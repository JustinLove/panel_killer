# Decorative Panel Killer

Removes several purely decorative panels, each of which is a full browser-tab like process.  Includes the building planets screen.

Shadows a core game file; it doesn't change very often, but if odd things happen, especially after a game update, this is a good one to try disabling.

The more adventurous could edit the mod to disable more panels, if there is a particular feature you don't personally use. panel.js is so core that you have restart the game to see changes.
